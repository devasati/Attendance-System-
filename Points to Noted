1.It Should be kept in mind that while using Add_Students_to_Lecture you are adding all the
registered students in the class/lecture who have not been assigned any class/lecture of
that course. If he is already a part of some lecture in same course then also he will not
be added and will be treated as conflicted. Also if he is already part of same lecture then he
will be treated as already added student.
